			<string>The Creative works sublime success,</string>
			<string>Furthering perseverance. </string>
			<string>*</string>
			<string>The beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the form</string>
			<string>of ideas that have yet to become real, like guitar strings at rest, a pen that lies idle, a brush that is yet to be picked up.  The Creative brings them</string>
			<string>forth. The wise one mounts the six steps toward heaven as if</string>
			<string>they were six dragons. The duration of time is the power</string>
			<string>inherent in the Creative: it is no hindrance, but the means of</string>
			<string>making actual what is yet potential. </string>
		</array>
		<key>Image</key>

			<string>The movement of the sky is full of power. </string>
			<string>Thus the superior being makes themself strong and untiring. </string>
			<string>*</string>
			<string>Each turning of Heaven makes a day, and day follows day with no</string>
			<string>lessening of Heaven&apos;s power.  Duration moves through time like a stallion, but also</string>
			<string>stands outside of time.  The sage becomes tireless by casting out</string>
			<string>all that is worthless and degrading.  In this way, the sage</string>
			<string>becomes a stalk, an enduring influence upon the Earth. </string>

			<string>Hidden Dragon.  Do not act. </string>
			<string>*</string>
			<string>In winter the dragon withdraws into the earth. </string>
			<string>In the summer the dragon arises as thunder, the dragon returns</string>
			<string>as lightning. </string>
			<string>Confident in their strength, the strong bide their time:</string>
			<string>Outward success or failure do not sway them. Wait in calm strength</string>

			<string>The second place is the surface of the Earth:</string>
			<string>It is the field in which the great one chooses to appear. </string>
			<string>The position of the great one may not be one of command,</string>
			<string>it may not be one of outward superiority. But a great one</string>
			<string>influences all that surrounds them. </string>
			<string>They should be sought. </string>

			<string>Danger.  No blame. </string>
			<string>*</string>
			<string>Opportunity knocks. Someone finds their stride. Their fame</string>
			<string>spreads. Masses flock and buoy up the superior. </string>
			<string>Ambition can destroy integrity, but true greatness knows not</string>
			<string>temptation. In the time that is dawning, beware the</string>
			<string>danger that lurks in the transition from lowliness to the</string>
			<string>place that others call heights. With prudence comes blamelessness. </string>

			<string>Two ways open to the Great One: one is the way of the world,</string>
			<string>the other the way of the sage. </string>
			<string>One may soar to great heights in the matters of the world,</string>
			<string>or withdraw to develop inner resources. </string>
			<string>No law says one is right - it is a matter of free choice</string>
			<string>and the inner law of truth to one&apos;s own being. </string>
			<string>The chosen path, well chosen, cannot be made wrong. </string>

			<string>Things that accord in tone vibrate together. Things that have</string>
			<string>affinity in their inmost natures seek one another. Water flows to what</string>
			<string>is wet, fire turns to what is dry. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows</string>
			<string>the tiger. Thus a sage arises, and all creatures follow</string>
			<string>with their eyes. What is born of heaven feels related to what is above,</string>
			<string>what is born of Earth feels related to what is below.  Each follows</string>
			<string>its kind. </string>

			<string>When one climbs too high, the crowds cannot be seen. </string>
			<string>Beware aspirations that exceed your ability. </string>
			<string>Arrogance means that one knows how to press forward, but not</string>
			<string>how to draw back; that one knows something of existence, but nothing</string>
			<string>of annihilation; knows something about winning, but nothing</string>
			<string>about losing. A precipitous fall will follow. </string>

			<string>If the superior one undertakes something and tries to lead, they go astray</string>
			<string>But if she follows, she finds guidance. </string>
			<string>It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,</string>
			<string>to forego friends in the east and north. </string>
			<string>Quiet perseverance brings good fortune. </string>
			<string>*</string>
			<string>Nature&apos;s richness lies in her power to nourish all living things, from the city gate to the mountain cave. </string>
			<string>The Earth in her devotion carries all things, good and evil, without</string>

			<string>The Earth&apos;s condition is receptive devotion. </string>
			<string>Thus the superior one who has breadth of character</string>

			<string>If a being is free of vanity they are able to conceal their</string>
			<string>abilities and keep them from attracting attention too soon. </string>
			<string>Thus they can mature undisturbed. The wise gladly leave fame to</string>

			<string>When anyone is called upon to work in a prominent but not</string>
